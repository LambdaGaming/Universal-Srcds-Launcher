# Contributing Guidelines
Thanks for being interested in contributing! Before you start, please read through the following guidelines. Most of these are not strictly enforced, but following all of them would be greatly appreciated by myself and other contributors. I reserve the right to reject a pull request or ignore an issue for any reason, though this rarely happens.

## AI Policy
I expect your submissions to be authentic. Do not use any sort of generative AI to create issues, artwork, sounds, etc. Using AI tools to help you write code or documentation is acceptable, but only if you fully understand everything you're submitting. If I have reason to believe your submission violates this policy, it will be rejected without further discussion. Repeat offenders and bot accounts will be permanently banned from contributing to any of my repos.

## Issues
- I accept all types of issues: Bug reports, documentation updates, feature requests, questions, etc. However, large discussions should take place on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9RGdUS2) rather than here.
- Make your report as detailed as possible. If you're submitting a bug report, describe the issue and list steps to reproduce it if possible. If you're submitting a feature request, describe what you want and explain why it would be beneficial.
- Verify that your issue wasn't already reported. Even if it's marked as closed and resolved, it can be reopened if necessary.
- Make a separate report for each issue you have, unless they're all closely related.
- Your report should be written in coherent English.

## Pull Requests
- Keep your PRs simple and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate PRs for each of them.
- Any large changes you plan on making should be discussed with me ahead of time. This will ensure you don't waste time on something that I end up rejecting.
- Use conventional programming methods and keep your formatting consistent with what's already written. Try to avoid doing unusual things that might leave others confused, and add comments next to or above any code that might need an explanation.
- Optimize your code as much as possible, but prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.
- Make sure everything works properly before submitting the PR. In most cases I will test it myself before accepting, but having it work the first time makes it easier for both of us.
