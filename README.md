# Universal Source Dedicated Server Launcher
 This is a replacement launcher compatible with any GoldSrc, Source, or Source 2 dedicated server that allows you to launch your servers with additional options, without having to use a command line or manually type out parameters for a shortcut. The launcher supports Windows 7 and newer, and should also work on any Linux distro with Mono installed.

# Features
- Option to use legacy launcher. If this is enabled, most other options will be disabled since the legacy launcher will ignore them.
- Map selection (`+map`)
  - Gets the names of maps inside the server's map folder. The map name can also be manually entered into the text box if the map is in a different location.
- Game/Gamemode selection (`+gamemode` or `-game`)
  - For Garry's Mod servers, the launcher will automatically update the list of gamemodes found in the server's gamemodes folder
  - For s&box servers, the box will be filled with a placeholder gamemode that can be manually changed
  - For all other games, it will use the name of the selected game folder
- LAN mode toggle (`+sv_lan`)
- Max players slider (`+maxplayers`)
- Password option (`+sv_password`)
- Steam token input (`+sv_setsteamaccount`)
  - Certain games including Garry's Mod and CS:GO require the server to be registered with Steam in this way for it to show up in the server browser
- Steam workshop collection option (`+host_workshop_collection`)
- Input for additional launch parameters
- Full Linux support
  - The launcher will automatically scan for installed terminals and launch the server through one of them. Only a handful of terminals are currently supported, so if you want to use one that's unsupported please let me know.
- All settings are saved when the launcher closes and will be automatically restored when the launcher is opened again.

# Notes
- If you need this program to run more than one server, you can copy the exe and rename it to something else to generate a new config.
- If you get a permission denied error when trying to start a server on Linux, make sure the srcds_run file(s) have execute permissions.
