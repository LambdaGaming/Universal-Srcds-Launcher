# Garry's Mod Server Launcher GUI With Console Support
 This is a replacement launcher for hosts who want to use the server's console mode while also wanting the full options that the normal GUI provides.

## Features:
- Prompts the user to select the file path that contains the server exe if the path is not found.
- Console mode toggle. Disables all other options if disabled since the main server GUI will take over at that point and ignore all launch arguments.
- Map selection that gets the names of maps inside the garrymod/maps server folder. The map name can also be manually entered into the text box if the map is in a different location.
- Support for the new Steam server tokens requirement so the server isn't stuck at the bottom of the server browser.
- Gamemode selection that gets the names of gamemodes inside the garrysmod/gamemodes server folder.
- LAN mode toggle.
- Max players selection.
- Password option.
- Steam workshop collection option.
- All settings mentioned above are saved when the program closes and will be automatically set when the program is reopened.

## Working with more than one server:
 If you need this program to run more than one server, you can copy the exe and rename it to something else to generate a new config.
